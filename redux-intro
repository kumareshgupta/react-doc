Actions are payloads of information that send data from application to store. They are the only source of information for the store.

<Field/>


redux-form primarily consists of four things:

1. A Redux reducer that listens to dispatched redux-form actions to maintain your form state in Redux.
2. A React component decorator that wraps your entire form in a Higher Order Component (HOC) and provides functionality via props.
3. A Field component to connect your individual field inputs to the Redux store.
4. Various Action Creators for interacting with your forms throughout the application.
