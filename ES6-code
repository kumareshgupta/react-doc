var :- function scoped
let :- block scoped

It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.

Difference between == and === 

The ‘==’ operator tests for abstract equality i.e. it does the necessary type conversions before doing the equality comparison.

‘===’ operator tests for strict equality i.e it will not do the type conversion hence if the two values are not of the same type, when compared, it will return false.


//function
let getValue = function(value=5, bonus=10){
  console.log(value+bonus)
}

//function call
getValue()
getValue(20)
getValue(30,20)
getValue(undefined, 20)
getValue(30,undefined)

===============================================

let percentVal = () => 0.1

let getValue = function(value=5, bonus=value*percentVal()){
  console.log(value + bonus)
  console.log(arguments.length)
  }
